Project Documentation: Contact Page Design
I. Project Overview:
This project aims to design and implement a modern, user-friendly contact page for a website. The contact page will include a form for users to send inquiries and will securely integrate with a Google Sheet for data collection.

II. Design Specifications:

A. Functionality:
Users can submit their name, email address (optional phone number), and message through a web form.
The form should implement real-time or on-submit validation for each field, providing clear error messages and visual cues (e.g., highlighted borders, icons) for invalid entries.
Upon successful submission, users should receive a confirmation message or be redirected to a "Thank you" page.

B. User Interface (UI):
Modern and clean design aesthetic.
Clear and easy-to-understand layout.
Responsive design that adapts optimally to various screen sizes and devices.
User-friendly form layout with clear labeling for each field.
Subtle and visually appealing animations or transitions (optional).

C. Technical Implementation:
Choose a front-end framework like React or Vue.js for building the contact form.
Utilize JavaScript libraries for form validation and user interaction (e.g., React Hook Form).
Employ CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.

III. Google Sheets Integration:
Utilize Google Sheets API to securely transmit form data to a designated Google Sheet.
Implement server-side functionality (e.g., Node.js) or consider third-party solutions like Formspree or JotForm for simplified integration (if security requirements allow).
Ensure secure communication protocols like HTTPS for data transmission.
Consider user data anonymization or encryption in the Google Sheet if sensitive information is collected (e.g., phone number).

IV. Deployment:
Deploy the project on a platform like Vercel for hosting the React application.
Configure Vercel to handle routing and server-side functionality (if applicable).
Provide the Vercel deployment link as part of the project submission.

V. Additional Considerations:
Accessibility: Ensure the contact page adheres to best practices for accessibility to cater to users with diverse needs.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing on various devices and browsers to ensure optimal user experience.
Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation for the project, including setup instructions, code comments, and information about the Google Sheets integration.

VI. Deliverables:
Functional contact page deployed on a platform like Vercel.
Public GitHub repository containing the source code and documentation.
This project documentation serves as a guide for the development of the contact page. Specific details and design decisions can be further refined as the project progresses.
