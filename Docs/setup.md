Setting Up Your Contact Page Project Locally
This guide outlines the steps to install dependencies and run your contact page project locally.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn): Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en (includes npm). Alternatively, you can use a package manager like yarn (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
Instructions:

Clone the project: Open your terminal and navigate to your desired directory using the cd command. Then, clone the project from your public GitHub repository using the following command, replacing <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with the actual name of your repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
Use code with caution.
Navigate to the project directory: Use the cd command to enter the project directory:
Bash
cd <repository-name>
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies: Run the following command in the terminal to install the project's required dependencies:
Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
(Alternatively, if you use yarn, the command would be yarn install.)

Start the development server: Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:
Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
(Again, use yarn start if you're using yarn.)

This will typically start the server on your local machine, often at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can access the contact page by opening this address in your web browser.
